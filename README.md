## The App
A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, although they have been a topic of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. 

WE FORGET almost all dreams soon after waking up. Our forgetfulness is generally attributed to neurochemical conditions in the brain that occur during REM sleep, a phase of sleep characterized by rapid eye movements and dreaming.

[**somniō**](http://rachelles-somnio.herokuapp.com) is a school project created based on my own experience with having frequent vivid dreams. With somniō, users can now quickly jot their dreams the moment they awaken.
